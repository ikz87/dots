# My polybar dots

If you are using this, chances are not all scripts will work, I didn't think I'd ever share this, but here we are.

Colors from the bar will be picked up from you Xresources, so if the bar doesn't seem to be loading correctly or has errors regarding "unscaped backslashes", it's probably because there's something wrong with the colors

Layout and workspaces modules will only work on bspwm (they depend on bspc)

## List of dependencies (probably incomplete):
-> xdo

-> xdotool

-> FontAwesome

-> Caskaydia Cove Nerd Font (Any nerd font will work, but you'll need to change polybar's config)
