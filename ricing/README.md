# Scripts all over the place

This is where I throw most of the scripts I use because I suck at keeping things ordered.

You should put this in your home directory and rename it to .ricing

Note: if you are gonna use any script that has to do with rofi, be sure to be using rofi 1.6.1, as that is the last version that supported command line options, needed for changing font, colors, dimensions and position of rofi depending on its usage
